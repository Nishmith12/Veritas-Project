# Project Veritas: MVP Plan

## 1. Problem Statement
Online commerce and information platforms are critically undermined by fake reviews, often generated by bots or malicious actors in coordinated "Sybil attacks." This erodes consumer trust and makes it difficult to assess true product quality.

## 2. Proposed Solution
A decentralized review platform that leverages blockchain for verifiable ownership and on-chain reputation, and AI for analyzing review content and user behavior to assign an "authenticity score."

## 3. Core Features (MVP Scope)
This is the checklist of what I will build.

- [ ] **User Wallet Connection:** A user can connect their MetaMask wallet to the web application.
- [ ] **Proof of Purchase:** An admin (me) can mint a "Receipt NFT" to a user's address to simulate a purchase.
- [ ] **Review Submission:** A user holding the correct Receipt NFT can submit a review (text only).
- [ ] **AI Scoring (Basic):** The submitted review text is sent to a backend API that returns a basic "fakeness score."
- [ ] **On-Chain Storage:** The review text's IPFS hash and the AI score are stored in a smart contract.
- [ ] **Display Reviews:** The web application fetches and displays all reviews for a product, along with the reviewer's address and authenticity score.

## 4. Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Ethers.js
- **Blockchain:** Solidity, Hardhat, Polygon Mumbai Testnet
- **Backend/AI:** Python, Flask, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Storage:** IPFS

## 5. Success Criteria
The project will be considered a success when I can perform a live demo showing:
1. A "genuine" user with a Receipt NFT successfully posting a review.
2. A "fake" user without the NFT being blocked from reviewing.
3. A review with "spammy" text being assigned a high "fakeness score" by the AI.
